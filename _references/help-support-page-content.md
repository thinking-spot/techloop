### FAQ Categories (Tabbed Navigation)

---

### Before Renting FAQs

**Q: How does the security deposit work?**

A: **We hold (not charge) a refundable deposit on your card.**

**How it works:**
1. When you sign up, we authorize a hold on your card (like hotels do)
2. This appears as "pending" on your statement
3. We never actually charge this amount (unless device is damaged/lost)
4. When you return the device in good condition, the hold is released
5. Your bank refunds the amount within 5-7 business days

**Deposit amounts:**
- **Starter plan:** $200 (1 device)
- **Explorer plan:** $350 (2 devices)  
- **Power User:** $200 per device

**Refund rate:** 98% of renters get 100% back

**What's covered:** Normal wear and tear (scratches, scuffs, worn pads)

**What's not covered:** Cracked screens, broken frames, water damage, loss/theft (unless you have insurance)

[Learn more about the security deposit →]

---

**Q: Are the devices actually brand new?**

A: **Your first rental is always brand new, factory sealed.**

**What "brand new" means:**
- Unopened retail packaging
- You're the first person to touch it
- Full manufacturer warranty included
- All accessories included (cables, cases, etc.)

**What happens after you return it:**
1. We professionally clean and inspect (medical-grade disinfectant + UV light)
2. If it passes inspection, it enters "Certified Pre-Owned" inventory
3. Future renters can choose CPO for slightly lower price ($8/mo discount)
4. You always get new unless you specifically choose CPO

**Bottom line:** You open the box first. Always.

---

**Q: What if the device doesn't work with my laptop/phone?**

A: **We'll help you check compatibility before renting.**

**Before you rent:**
1. Use our [Compatibility Checker Tool →]
2. Enter your device model (laptop, phone, etc.)
3. We'll tell you if it works
4. If unsure, chat with us first

**If it doesn't work after receiving:**
- Contact us within 48 hours
- We'll troubleshoot or issue full refund (rental fee + deposit)
- This happens <2% of the time (usually user error or adapter needed)

**Most compatible:**
- XREAL: 2020+ laptops with USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode
- Meta Ray-Ban: Any phone with Bluetooth 5.0+
- Oura/Samsung Ring: Any phone with Bluetooth 4.0+

---

**Q: Can I try multiple devices to compare?**

A: **Yes! That's the whole point. Three ways to do it:**

**Option 1: Swap between devices (most common)**
- Rent Meta Ray-Ban for 1-2 months
- Request swap to XREAL Air 2 Pro
- Try for 1-2 months
- Decide which you prefer
- **Cost:** 2-3 months rental ($93-135 total)

**Option 2: Rent 2+ devices simultaneously (Explorer/Power User plans)**
- Get Meta Ray-Ban + Oura Ring at same time
- Compare side-by-side
- Keep your favorite(s)
- **Cost:** $84/mo for 2 devices (Explorer plan)

**Option 3: Rent → Return → Rent different device**
- Rent, try, return (get deposit back)
- Rent different device fresh
- Works but slower (2 separate rental periods)

**Most popular:** Option 1 (sequential swaps). Gets you both devices for $93-135 total to make informed decision.

---

**Q: How long does shipping take?**

A: **2-3 business days (standard free shipping).**

**Timeline:**
- **Order placed:** Device ships within 1 business day (24 hours)
- **In transit:** 2-3 business days via UPS/FedEx
- **Total:** 3-4 days from order to your door

**Example:**
- Order Monday morning → Ships Monday afternoon → Arrives Wednesday/Thursday

**Faster shipping:**
- **Express (1-2 days):** +$15 (order by 2pm PT for same-day ship)
- **Overnight:** +$35 (limited availability)

**Tracking:**
- Emailed as soon as device ships
- Track in real-time via account dashboard

---

### During Rental FAQs

**Q: What's the 30-day minimum?**

A: **You must keep each device for at least 30 days before swapping or returning.**

**Why we have this:**
- Gives you time to actually integrate device into your life
- Week 1 = novelty, Week 2 = learning curve, Week 3-4 = real habits form
- Prevents "serial swappers" who never actually try anything

**What happens if you want to swap sooner:**
- Early swap fee: $50 (only if you truly can't stand the device)
- Most people don't need this (30 days goes fast)

**After 30 days:**
- Swap anytime using your 4 free swaps per year
- Or keep renting month-to-month (no commitment)

**Exception:**
- Incompatibility (device doesn't work with your laptop/phone)
- We'll swap immediately with no fee if it's compatibility issue

---

**Q: Can I pause my subscription?**

A: **Yes, up to 3 months per year.**

**How it works:**

**Option 1: Pause with device (keep using it)**
- You: "I want to pause my subscription"
- Us: "Okay, we won't charge you next month"
- You: Keep using device for $0
- After pause period: Monthly charges resume
- **Use case:** Temporary budget tightness, travel, etc.

**Option 2: Pause without device (return it)**
- You: "I want to pause and return device"
- Us: "No problem, ship it back"
- You: Return device, we hold your spot
- When ready: We ship device back to you
- **Use case:** Long trip, moving, don't need it for a few months

**Limits:**
- 3 months total per year (can be split: 1 month + 1 month + 1 month)
- Can't pause in first 30 days (must complete minimum)

---

**Q: What counts as "normal wear and tear"?**

A: **Most real-world use is covered. Here's the breakdown:**

**Normal Wear (Covered ✅):**
- Light scratches on lenses (from normal use)
- Scuffed frames (from putting in bag)
- Worn nose pads (from daily wear)
- Faded coating (from skin oils)
- Minor cosmetic issues (small dings)
- Cleaned but slightly discolored (from sweat)

**Accidental Damage (Not Covered ❌ without insurance):**
- Cracked lenses (dropped, sat on)
- Broken frames (snapped temple)
- Deep scratches (keys in bag)
- Water damage (dropped in pool)
- Broken charging ports

**How we decide:**
- Photos on return (you take photos before shipping)
- Our team inspects when received
- If unclear, we give benefit of doubt
- 98% of returns = full deposit back

**Pro tip:** Take photos when you receive device (proof of condition). Take photos before returning (proof you didn't damage it).

---

**Q: Can I buy the device I'm renting?**

A: **Yes, anytime! And you get 40-60% off retail.**

**How rent-to-own pricing works:**

Example: Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses ($299 retail)

| After | You've Paid | Buyout Price | Total | vs Retail |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| 1 month | $45 | $254 (85%) | $299 | Same price |
| 3 months | $135 | $180 (60%) | $315 | +$16 |
| 6 months | $270 | $135 (45%) | $405 | +$106 |
| 12 months | $540 | $75 (25%) | $615 | +$316 |

**Sweet spot:** Months 3-6 (you've tested thoroughly, buyout discount is meaningful)

**What happens when you buy:**
1. Choose "Buy This Device" in your account
2. Pay the buyout price (one-time charge)
3. Security deposit refunded immediately
4. You keep the exact device you've been using
5. Warranty transfers to you (remainder of original warranty)

**Do you save money?**
- If you buy after 1-3 months: Yes, roughly same as retail but you tested it first
- If you buy after 6+ months: You pay premium, but you had 6+ months risk-free
- If you keep renting forever: You never own, but always have latest tech

---

### Swaps & Returns FAQs

**Q: How do I request a swap?**

A: **Four simple steps, takes 5-7 days total.**

**Step 1: Request Swap (2 minutes)**
- Log into your account
- Click "Request Swap"
- Choose your next device from catalog
- Confirm swap request

**Step 2: New Device Ships (2-3 days)**
- We ship your new device

**Step 3: Return Old Device (3 days)**

- Day 5-7: Swap complete

**Cost:**
- Free swaps: 4 per year (1 per quarter)
- Additional swaps: $50 each

---

**Q: What if I want to swap to a more expensive device?**

A: **No problem. Your monthly price adjusts.**

**Example:**

**Current:** Renting Nothing Ear ($18/mo)  
**Want:** Swap to Meta Ray-Ban ($45/mo)

**What happens:**
1. Request swap to Ray-Ban
2. Your new monthly price: $45/mo (starts next billing cycle)
3. Security deposit: Additional $200 hold (total $200 for Ray-Ban)
4. Previous deposit ($100 for Nothing Ear) released

**If swapping to cheaper device:**
- Monthly price decreases
- Excess deposit released immediately

**You only pay the monthly rate for the device you currently have.**

---

**Q: Can I return my device anytime?**

A: **Yes, after 30-day minimum. Here's how:**

**Step 1: Cancel Subscription (2 minutes)**
- Log into account → "Cancel Subscription"
- Choose reason (optional, helps us improve)
- We'll ask "Are you sure?" (retention attempt)
- Confirm cancellation

**Step 2: Return Device (14 days)**
- You have 14 days to ship device back
- Use prepaid return label (emailed + in account)
- Pack securely (original box ideal, any box works)
- Drop at UPS/FedEx

**Step 3: Get Deposit Back (5-7 days)**
- We receive and inspect device (usually same day)
- If good condition: Deposit released immediately
- Your bank processes refund (5-7 business days)

**Timeline:**
- Cancel today → Ship within 14 days → Deposit back in 7-10 days total

**No cancellation fees. No retention calls. No hassle.**

---

### Buying FAQs

**Q: If I buy my device, do I keep the warranty?**

A: **Yes, the remainder of the original manufacturer warranty transfers to you.**

**How it works:**

**Example:** Meta Ray-Ban (1-year manufacturer warranty)

- You rent for 4 months, then buy
- Original warranty started when we bought it (maybe 5 months ago)
- You get 7 months remaining warranty
- Warranty honored by Meta directly (not us)

**What's covered:**
- Manufacturing defects
- Hardware failures (not your fault)
- Battery issues (beyond normal degradation)

**What's NOT covered:**
- Accidental damage (you dropped it)
- Normal wear and tear
- Lost/stolen devices

**Extended warranty:**
- Some manufacturers offer extended warranty purchases
- You can buy directly from manufacturer after owning

**Bottom line:** You get remaining factory warranty. After that, you're on your own (like any normal product purchase).

---

**Q: Can I finance my purchase?**

A: **Not yet, but rent-to-own is basically the same thing.**

**Why rent-to-own works like financing:**

**Traditional financing:**
- Buy $299 device with Affirm/Klarna
- Pay $50/month for 6 months ($300 total)
- You own it immediately, but pay over time
- Stuck with it even if you hate it

**TechLoop rent-to-own:**
- Rent $299 device for $45/month
- Try for 6 months ($270 total)
- Buy for $135 ($405 total = $106 more than retail)
- But you tested it for 6 months first (zero risk)

**The $106 "premium" = insurance against $299 mistake.**

**We might add financing later:**
- For the buyout amount (not the rental)
- Example: After 6 months, finance the $135 buyout over 3 months
- Under consideration for 2025

---

### Technical FAQs

**Q: My device won't turn on. What should I do?**

A: **Troubleshoot in this order:**

**Step 1: Check battery (most common cause)**
- Plug into charger for 15 minutes
- Look for charging indicator light
- Try different cable/adapter (cable might be bad)
- Try different outlet (outlet might be dead)

**Step 2: Force restart**
- **Meta Ray-Ban:** Hold power button 10 seconds
- **XREAL:** Unplug and replug USB-C cable
- **Oura/Samsung Ring:** Place on charger, wait 1 minute
- **Nothing Ear:** Place in case, close lid, wait 30 seconds

**Step 3: Check for damage**
- Any visible cracks or breaks?
- Was device dropped recently?
- Any water exposure?

**Step 4: Contact us**
- If none of above work, it's likely defective
- Text/email us: [support contact]
- We'll troubleshoot further or send replacement
- Replacement ships same day (arrives in 2-3 days)

**Defective devices:** Covered 100% under warranty. You're not charged anything.

---

**Q: My XREAL glasses show a blurry display. How do I fix it?**

A: **90% of the time, it's a fit issue. Here's the fix:**

**Problem 1: Wrong nose pad size**

**Symptoms:** Entire display blurry, edges especially

**Fix:**
1. Remove current nose pads (gently pull off)
2. Try the next size (Small → Medium → Large)
3. Snap on new pads
4. Put on glasses, check if sharper

**Most people:** Medium works (pre-installed)  
**Smaller faces:** Need Small  
**Larger faces:** Need Large

---

**Problem 2: IPD (Interpupillary Distance) mismatch**

**Symptoms:** Double vision, eyestrain after 30 min

**Explanation:** XREAL is fixed at 64mm IPD. Your eyes might be wider/narrower.

**Check your IPD:**
- Visit optometrist (they measure free)
- Use iPhone app "EyeMeasure" (decent accuracy)
- Average: 60-68mm (most people fall here)

**If your IPD is 67mm+:** XREAL might not work well for you (eyestrain)

**Solution:** Contact us for swap to different device (Meta Ray-Ban has no IPD issues)

---

**Problem 3: Dirty lenses**

**Symptoms:** Spots, smudges, overall haziness

**Fix:**
1. Use included microfiber cloth
2. Gentle circular motions
3. Don't use shirt/paper towels (scratches lens)
4. For stubborn smudges: Lens cleaning spray (eyeglass stores)

---

**Problem 4: Source device resolution wrong**

**Symptoms:** Display looks stretched or pixelated

**Fix:**
1. Check your laptop/phone settings
2. Set display output to 1920x1080 (native XREAL resolution)
3. Avoid scaling (use 100%)

**If still blurry after all this:** Contact us, might be defective unit.

---

**Q: My Oura Ring isn't syncing. What should I do?**

A: **Follow this troubleshooting sequence:**

- Is phone within 30 feet of ring?
- Try turning Bluetooth off/on

**Step 2: Force sync in app**
- Open Oura app
- Pull down on home screen (refresh gesture)
- Wait 30 seconds for sync

**Step 3: Restart ring**
- Place ring on charger
- Wait 1 minute
- Remove from charger
- Check app again

**Step 4: Re-pair ring**

- Wait 10 seconds
- Place back on charger
- Oura app → Add New Device
- Follow pairing process

**Step 5: Restart phone**
- Turn phone completely off
- Wait 30 seconds
- Turn back on
- Check if syncing works

5. Video plays (are people watching tutorials?)
6. Device manual downloads (which devices need most help?)

**Contact Conversion:**

13. Repeat help page visits (are people getting stuck repeatedly?)

---

**Help Article Usefulness:** 85%+ "yes" on "Was this helpful?" button

---

### Continuous Improvement Loop

**Weekly:**
- Review most-searched terms (are we missing help articles?)
- Analyze most-opened FAQ questions (should these be more prominent?)
- Check support ticket themes (patterns = need new help content)

**Monthly:**
- Update help content based on new device issues

- Refresh video tutorials if outdated
- Review customer feedback submissions

**Quarterly:**

- A/B test page layout changes

- Benchmark against competitors (Rent the Runway, Grover, etc.)

---

## A/B Testing Roadmap

### Test 1: Search Prominence

**Version A:** Search bar in hero only (current)  
**Version B:** Sticky search bar (always visible)  
**Version C:** Search + quick links (search + 5 popular articles)

**Hypothesis:** Sticky search increases usage, reduces support contacts

---

### Test 2: Contact Options Order

**Version A:** Chat → Text → Email → Call (current)  
**Version B:** Text → Chat → Email → Call (mobile-first)  
**Version C:** Chat only prominently (funnel to fastest channel)

**Hypothesis:** Prioritizing fastest channel reduces wait times

---

### Test 3: FAQ Format

**Version A:** Accordion (click to expand)  
**Version B:** All visible (no expanding)  
**Version C:** Categorized tabs + accordion

**Hypothesis:** Visible FAQs increase self-service rate

---

### Test 4: Video vs Text Tutorials

**Version A:** Mix of video and text guides (current)  
**Version B:** Video-first (text transcripts below)  
**Version C:** Text-only (faster loading)

**Hypothesis:** Video increases engagement but text is faster to scan

## Conclusion: Support as Competitive Advantage

**Why great support matters for TechLoop:**

1. **Retention:** Users who get fast help = 2.3x more likely to extend rental (LTV increase)
2. **NPS:** Fast support = higher Net Promoter Score = word-of-mouth growth
3. **Differentiation:** Most rental companies have terrible support. We can win on service.
4. **Cost:** Self-service deflects 70% of tickets = massive cost savings at scale
5. **Learning:** Support conversations reveal product issues, feature requests, roadmap priorities

**Goal:** Make support so good that people mention it in reviews.
