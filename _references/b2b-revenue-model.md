## The Two-Sided Value Proposition

### Side 1: Consumers (Demand Side)
**Problem:** $400+ devices, commitment anxiety, can't try before buying  
**Solution:** Rent for $48-84/mo, swap anytime, rent-to-own option  
**We Charge:** Monthly subscription fees + swap fees + buyout prices

### Side 2: Manufacturers (Supply Side)
**Problem:** $2,000+ CAC via ads, no distribution, unclear product-market fit  
**Solution:** We place devices with qualified users, provide usage data, run enterprise pilots  
**We Charge:** Placement fees + competitive intelligence subscriptions + enterprise pilot fees

## The Strategic Insight: Manufacturers Pay for Consumer Acquisition

**The Math:**
- Consumer CAC: $150/user
- 10,000 users × $150 = $1,500,000 CAC spend

**Manufacturer contributions:**
- Placement fees: $1,525,000
- **This EXCEEDS our entire CAC spend**

**What this means:**
- Manufacturers are effectively funding consumer growth
- Every dollar they pay in placement fees reduces capital we need
- We're not paying for inventory OR customer acquisition
- Pure arbitrage: They pay us to distribute their products

**Traditional Marketplace Problem:**
- Chicken and egg: Need supply to attract demand, need demand to attract supply
- Requires heavy subsidy on one side (usually supply)

**Our Solution:**
- Manufacturers so desperate for distribution they subsidize BOTH sides
- They pay placement fees (supply subsidy)
- AND provide devices free/cheap (demand subsidy)
- We profit from both sides
