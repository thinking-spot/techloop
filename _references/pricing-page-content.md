## How Swaps Work Section

### Headline
Swap Devices. Find Your Perfect Match.

**Subheadline:**
Not sure which smart glasses are right for you? Try XREAL, then swap to Meta Ray-Ban, then try Brilliant Labs. Find your favorite risk-free.

**Visual: 4-Step Process Diagram**

**Step 1: Choose Your Device**
Browse our catalog and pick what you want to try first. Brand new device ships within 2 business days.

**Step 2: Try It for 30 Days**
Use it in your daily life. Take it to work. Wear it on vacation. Really test it out.

**Step 3: Decide**
Love it? Keep paying monthly or buy it outright (40-60% off retail). Want to try something else? Swap it.

**Step 4: Swap (Up to 4 Times Per Year, Free)**
Request a swap in your dashboard. We'll ship your next device. Return the old one in prepaid packaging.

**Callout Box:**
💡 **Pro Tip:** Use your 4 free swaps strategically:  
• Q1: Try smart glasses (XREAL)  
• Q2: Swap to competitor (Meta Ray-Ban)  
• Q3: Try smart ring (Oura)  
• Q4: Try AI earbuds (Nothing Ear)

**Fine Print:**
Need to swap more than 4 times per year? Additional swaps are $50 each. Early swap before 30-day minimum? Also $50 (we want you to really try it first).

## Security Deposit Section

### Headline
Refundable Security Deposit (Just Like Your Apartment)

**Explanation:**
To protect our devices, we collect a refundable security deposit. You get it back in full when you:
- Return the device in good condition, OR
- Purchase the device (deposit goes toward purchase price)

**Pricing:**
- Starter (1 device): $200 deposit
- Explorer (2 devices): $350 deposit  
- Power User (3+ devices): $200 per device

**What it covers:**
- Normal wear and tear: ✓ Covered (no charge)
- Lost charging cable: ✓ Covered (no charge)
- Scratches/scuffs: ✓ Covered (no charge)
- Cracked lens or major damage: Partial deposit withheld
- Lost or stolen device: Full deposit withheld (file insurance claim)

**Callout:**
We're not trying to keep your deposit—we just want our devices back. 98% of our users get 100% of their deposit refunded.

---

## Rent-to-Own Section

### Headline
Fall in Love? Keep It.

**Subheadline:**
After 6+ months of renting, you can purchase your device at a significant discount. Your rental payments count toward ownership.

**Example Calculation:**

**XREAL Air 2 Pro**
- Retail price: $399
- Rental @ $48/mo × 6 months = $288 paid
- Buyout price after 6 months: $180
- **Total you pay: $468** ($69 more than buying retail)
- **But you got:** 6 months to decide, ability to swap if you hated it, zero commitment

**vs. Financing:**
- Affirm/Klarna at 15% APR: $36/mo × 12 = $432
- Our model: Try first, then buy for just $36 more

**Buyout Pricing:**
- After 3 months: 60% of retail price
- After 6 months: 45% of retail price
- After 9 months: 35% of retail price
- After 12 months: 30% of retail price

*The longer you rent, the less you pay to keep it.*

**CTA:** See Available Devices →

## FAQ Section

### Headline
Questions? We've Got Answers.

**Q: What devices can I choose from?**

We offer the latest AI wearables across four categories:

**Smart Glasses:** XREAL Air 2 Pro, Meta Ray-Ban, Brilliant Labs Frame, Even Realities G1

**Smart Rings:** Oura Ring Gen 4, Samsung Galaxy Ring, Circular Ring Slim

**AI Earbuds:** Nothing Ear, Nothing Ear (a), Soundcore Liberty 4

**AI Pins:** (Coming soon - Rabbit R1 alternatives)

*New devices added monthly as they launch.*

---

**Q: Are these actually brand new devices?**

Yes! Your first rental of any device is always brand new, factory sealed. When you return it, we professionally refurbish it to like-new condition, then it becomes available in our "Certified Pre-Owned" tier (launching Q2 2025) at a lower price.

You always know if you're getting new vs. certified pre-owned. There's no mystery.

---

**Q: What if I damage the device?**

Normal wear and tear is expected and covered. We're talking:
- Scratches on lenses
- Scuff marks on frame
- Worn ear tips
- Minor cosmetic damage

Not covered (deducted from security deposit):
- Cracked screens/lenses
- Water damage (if not waterproof)
- Intentional damage
- Lost or stolen devices (file insurance claim)

98% of our users return devices with zero deposit deduction.

---

**Q: How do swaps work exactly?**

1. Log into your TechLoop dashboard
2. Click "Request Swap"
3. Choose your next device
4. We ship it to you (arrives in 2-3 business days)
5. You have 3 days to return old device in prepaid packaging
6. That's it!

Your billing stays the same—$48/mo for Starter, $84/mo for Explorer, etc. No gaps in service.

---

**Q: What's the catch with 4 free swaps per year?**

No catch! We genuinely want you to find the right device for you. 

The 4-swap limit exists because:
- Each swap costs us ~$100 (shipping both ways + refurb)
- We're profitable at 2-3 swaps per user per year
- 4 swaps = quarterly cadence = very generous
- Most users only swap 1-2 times before finding their favorite

If you need more than 4 swaps, we charge $50 per additional swap (partially covers our costs). But 99% of users never hit the limit.

---

**Q: Can I pause my subscription?**

Yes! You can pause for up to 3 months per year. 

**How it works:**
- Return your current device
- We pause billing
- Your security deposit stays active
- When you're ready, resume and choose a new device

**Perfect for:**
- Long vacations
- Busy work periods
- Trying devices seasonally (ring in summer for running, glasses in winter for skiing)

---

**Q: How is this different from buying on Amazon with 30-day returns?**

**Amazon Returns:**
- 30 days to decide
- If you return, you get nothing
- If you keep, you paid full price
- Can't try a second device without buying another one

**TechLoop:**
- 30-day minimum, but no maximum (rent as long as you want)
- If you return, you can try a different device
- If you keep, you get 40-60% off retail
- Try up to 5 devices per year on Starter plan

We're try-before-buy on steroids.

---

**Q: What if the device I want is out of stock?**

We order devices based on demand. If your first-choice device is temporarily unavailable:

1. Join the waitlist (you get notified when it's back, usually 1-2 weeks)
2. Choose a similar device to try while you wait
3. Get priority access when it's restocked

We don't charge you until your device ships.

---

**Q: Can I gift a TechLoop subscription?**

Yes! Gift subscriptions available:

- 3-month gift: $144 (Starter) or $252 (Explorer)
- 6-month gift: $288 (Starter) or $504 (Explorer)
- 12-month gift: $576 (Starter) or $1,008 (Explorer)

Recipient chooses their own devices. Security deposit required from recipient.

*Perfect for holidays, birthdays, or curious tech lovers.*

---

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**

YES. Truly no commitment.

**To cancel:**
1. Log into dashboard
2. Click "Cancel Subscription"
3. Return device within 14 days using prepaid label
4. We refund your security deposit within 7 days of receiving device

No cancellation fees. No questions asked. No retention calls.

**What happens if I don't return device within 14 days?**

(Don't worry, we send 3 reminder emails before charging.)

## Social Proof Section

### Headline
Join 1,000+ People Already Trying AI Wearables Risk-Free

**Testimonial 1:**
"I wanted smart glasses but wasn't sure which ones. Tried XREAL, didn't love them. Swapped to Meta Ray-Ban and now I wear them every day. Bought them after 4 months for $180. Total no-brainer."

— Marcus T., Software Engineer, SF

**Testimonial 2:**
"The Explorer plan is perfect. I rent both an Oura Ring and XREAL glasses. $84/month to try $750 worth of devices? I'm saving up to buy them both, but trying before committing saved me from buying the Samsung ring which I hated after 2 weeks."

— Priya K., Product Manager, NYC

**Testimonial 3:**
"I cycle through AI earbuds every quarter. Tried Nothing Ear, then swapped to Soundcore, now trying the new CMF Buds. Found my favorite and bought them. This is how ALL tech should work."

— James L., Tech Enthusiast, Austin

## Copy Principles Used Throughout

1. **Lead with value, not price**
   - "$1.60/day" is more palatable than "$48/month"
   - "Try $400 devices" emphasizes savings

2. **Remove friction at every step**
   - "Cancel anytime" repeated 6 times
   - "No credit check" prominently displayed
   - "Brand new devices" addresses used device concerns

3. **Use comparison anchors**
   - "Compare to buying..." shows savings
   - "vs. Affirm financing..." shows value
   - "Grover charges $45/mo for used devices" positions premium

4. **Address objections preemptively**
   - FAQ addresses: damage, swaps, stock, commitment
   - Social proof shows real users succeeding
   - Trust badges alleviate security concerns

5. **Create urgency (but not fake scarcity)**
   - "New devices added monthly" (FOMO on new tech)
   - "1,000+ users already trying" (social proof)
   - No fake countdown timers or "only 3 spots left"

6. **Emphasize flexibility as core value prop**
   - Swap system explained thoroughly
   - Rent-to-own detailed with math
   - Pause subscription option highlighted

7. **Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)**
   - All costs shown upfront
   - Deposit explanation clear
   - Additional swap fees disclosed
   - No surprises at checkout
