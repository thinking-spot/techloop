# Questions? We've got answers.

### Subheadline
Here's what everyone asks before signing up.

### Featured FAQs (Accordion Style)

**Q: Are these actually brand new devices?**

**A:** Yes! Your first rental of any device is brand new, factory sealed. You're the first person to wear it. When you return it, we professionally refurbish it to like-new condition for our "Certified Pre-Owned" tier (launching soon).

---

**Q: What if I damage the device?**

**A:** Normal wear and tear is totally covered (scratches, scuffs, worn ear tips). Accidental damage (cracked lens, water damage) is deducted from your security deposit. 98% of our users return devices with zero deductions. Optional insurance available for $5/month.

---

**Q: How do swaps work?**

**A:** Log in, click "Request Swap," choose your next device. We ship it in 2-3 days. You return the old one in prepaid packaging within 3 days. Your billing stays the same - no gaps in service. You get 4 free swaps per year (quarterly). Additional swaps are $50 each.

---

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**

**A:** YES. Click "Cancel" in your dashboard, return the device within 14 days using our prepaid label, and we refund your security deposit within 7 days. No fees. No retention calls. No hoops.

**If you don't return it:** We charge you full retail price after 14 days (then it's yours to keep).

## Key Copywriting Techniques Used

### 1. Problem-First Framing
"Want to try smart glasses? That's $399 upfront. Hate them after a week? You're out $399."

This establishes the pain point immediately before offering solution.

### 2. Concrete Math
"Try 3 devices for $288 total. If you bought all 3 on Amazon to compare, that's $1,197. You save $909."

Specific numbers are more persuasive than vague "save money" claims.

### 3. Real User Language
"Look normal. Act superhuman." (Meta Ray-Ban)  
"Your body's story, told by a ring." (Oura)

Emotional, aspirational copy instead of just listing specs.

### 4. Objection Pre-emption
Every major objection addressed on homepage:
- "Are they new?" → Yes, factory sealed
- "What if I damage it?" → 98% get full deposit back
- "Can I cancel?" → Yes, anytime, no fees

### 5. Choice Abundance
"Most people try 3-5 devices before finding 'the one.' Some stay forever renters. Some buy everything. There's no right path. Just your path."

Removes pressure, makes exploration feel okay.

### 6. Social Proof Specificity
Not just "thousands of users" but:
- 1,000+ users (specific number)
- 4.8/5 stars (347 reviews) (credible, not "perfect")
- 98% get full deposit back (shows we're not trying to scam)

### 7. Comparison Anchoring
"$48/month" feels cheap when anchored against "$399 upfront"

### 8. Future Pacing
"Work on a massive display from coffee shops. Watch movies on flights."

Helps reader visualize themselves using device.

### 9. Category Signal
Device cards have clear badges: SMART GLASSES, SMART RING, AI EARBUDS

Helps scanners find what they want quickly.

### 10. Micro-Commitments
First CTA is "Find Your Device" (quiz, low commitment)  
Not "Sign Up Now" (high commitment)

## Conversion Funnel Strategy

**Homepage Goal:** Get users into ONE of three funnels

**Funnel 1: Quiz Takers (Highest Intent)**
- Hero CTA: "Find Your Device" → Quiz
- End of quiz → Device recommendation → Pricing selection → Checkout

**Funnel 2: Browsers (Medium Intent)**
- "View All Devices" → Catalog → Device detail page → Pricing → Checkout

**Funnel 3: Researchers (Lower Intent)**
- "How It Works" → Process explanation → FAQ → Pricing → Checkout
- These users need more education before converting

**Analytics Focus:**
- Track which funnel converts best
- Optimize for Quiz funnel (likely highest conversion)

---

## A/B Testing Roadmap

**Test 1: Hero Headline**
- Version A: "Try $400 AI devices for $48/month"
- Version B: "Rent AI wearables. Return anytime."
- Hypothesis: Specific price point converts better than vague benefit

**Test 2: Hero CTA**
- Version A: "Find Your Device" (current)
- Version B: "Take Device Quiz"
- Hypothesis: "Quiz" is more specific, converts better

**Test 3: Device Card Layout**
- Version A: 6 featured devices (current)
- Version B: 3 featured devices + "View All 12 Devices"
- Hypothesis: Less choice paradox = higher conversion

**Test 4: Social Proof Position**
- Version A: Social proof after devices (current)
- Version B: Social proof after hero (earlier trust building)
- Hypothesis: Early social proof reduces bounce rate

**Test 5: Pricing Teaser**
- Version A: Show pricing cards (current)
- Version B: Hide pricing, just "See Pricing" CTA
- Hypothesis: Deferring pricing reduces sticker shock
